  We're so fucking back.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's been a while since I've typed up much of anything coherent so pardon me if I sound disjointed, but hoo-fucking-ray the blog is back and looking better than ever. I've taken a lot of time lately to work on my image since I'd started feeling dissatisfied with my (to be fair, on purpose) <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20231129052359/https://magentahardcore.com/'>shitty website layout</a> and wanted to <b>RETVRN</b> to my <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20230409223832/https://n1l.neocities.org/'>previous site layout</a>. So I did; then I kept chipping away at it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyway, here we are with a brand new <a href='https://magentahardcore.com/'>homepage</a>; a <a href='https://crypt.magentahardcore.com/'>beautiful blog</a>; and a lot of new branding to match (thank you to <a href='https://wikipedia.com/'>Wikipedia</a> and the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/'>Creative Commons</a> for supplying more than I would ever care to admit, and to Nyx for being so kind as to let me plunder her code on <a href='https://unlife.nyx.land/'>Unlife</a> blind for this blog (snitches get stitches).). I've not been in work lately so I have more time to focus on my creative and intellectual endeavors (read: my bullshit) and get to generally do what I please; it also means I do not have an income. If you'd like to chip in you can purchase my albums <a href='https://333voidgirl.bandcamp.com/'>here</a>, send me currency <a href ='https://magentahardcore.com/etc/help/support.html'>here</a> and view my commission info <a href='https://magentahardcore.com/etc/help/commissions.html'>here</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's enough manually typing all this HTML as I write these paragraphs for now. Check out my latest tape <a href='https://333voidgirl.bandcamp.com/album/w1tchstyl3'>W1TCHSTYL3</a> if you haven't already. Additionally, the 1 year anniversary for <a href='https://333voidgirl.bandcamp.com/album/lilith-worship-musick'>LILITH WORSHIP MUSICK </a> is coming up on the 20th so I'll try to write something to celebrate it since it meant a lot to me<span style="color: #a3ff00">*</span>.
