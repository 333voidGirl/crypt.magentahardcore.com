  Happy Magenta Hardcore update!!! This year has been pretty Nil-free (null of nil or smth idk) and I apologize for that. Life circumstances caused me to be distracted from and dejected by my work for a rather long time, but I'm not back empty handed! I've released a short EP, <a href="">HASENHEXE</a>; done a fuuuck ton of branding bullshit; and dropped this blogpost you're reading happily :3
  Honestly I don't feel super happy about the visual state of the blog but I'll likely get around to fixing it up further once I have more written stuff to upload. 
  In other news I've been out of a job for a bit and am unable to continue my SoundCloud Artist subscription at the moment. Streaming is unaffected by this but if you'd like to help me out for any reason you can buy my music on <a href="https://333voidgirl.bandcamp.com/">BandCamp</a> or donate to me <a hre="https://magentahardcore.com/etc/support/donate.html">here</a> (links include a new Patreon I've been working on adding some stuff to, such as some instrumentals and a link to my Discord server).
  I don't really have a ton I feel like writing about this update but I hope the care I've put into the actual content is obvious. I'll start releasing more new stuff on streaming over time. Despite my attitude lately I still have a lot of art I've worked on. If you'd like to leave any comments I'd encourage dropping a message on my <a href="https://magentahardcore.atabook.org/">Guestbook</a>!
